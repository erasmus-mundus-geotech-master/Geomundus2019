            <p align="justify">
                <a class="link_keynote" href="https://iapg.jade-hs.de/members/brinkhoff/" target="_blank"><strong> Prof. Dr. Thomas Brinkhoff</strong></a> is a professor in Geoinformatics at the Jade University in Oldenburg. He is also a member of the
                OFFIS Institute for Information Technology Oldenburg and the Center for Sustainable Spatial Development in Oldenburg (ZENARiO). He serves currently as chair of the Society of Geoinformatics in Northern Germany (GiN) and as a member of
                several program committees.<br /> His main research and teaching interest is the management of spatial data. Thomas Brinkhoff studied computer science at the University of Bremen. He received his doctoral degree from the Ludwig-Maximilians-University
                of Munich for his work on efficient processing of spatial joins in spatial database system. Before his current position, he worked as a project manager on Geographic Information System (GIS) solutions for traffic information and emergency
                services.
                <br /> Thomas Brinkhoff wrote the first German textbook about spatial database system, which is currently published in the third edition. His network-based generator of moving objects has been used by several hundreds of publications as
                a benchmark for spatiotemporal data structures and algorithms. He also runs a <strong> popular website</strong> that is based on georeferenced population data.<br/> His current works are related to the management and analysis of spatial
                sensor data and of data from Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) projects. He was significantly involved in the development of the master course “Spatial Information Science” in Oldenburg that offers three specializations; one of
                them is the analysis of spatial data.<br />
                <h4 style="color: #FFCD03; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">KEYNOTE (working title): </br>“What is special about spatial data management?”</h4>
                The question “What is special about spatial?” has been asked for decades. Do we really need special solutions for handling geospatial data? Having this question in mind, the talk will discuss several previous and current challenges in spatial data management
                and their (possible) solutions.

                Talking about the geospatial tools we are using in the humanitarian world now, and also giving a reality check on what works and what doesn't, what is practical vs. a wish list - especially where we need the fresh graduates and younger innovators to come
                in and help.

                <h4 style="color: #FFCD03; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">KEYNOTE (working title):</br> Geospatial technologies are here...</h4>
                GIS has been for decades a very specialized field strongly dedicated to specific domains such as urban planning or environment. GIS experts represent a rich group of diverse professional skills and profiles who have work together to merge diverse disciplines such as cartography, topography, design or IT technologies. Far from the big audiences, GIS have been watching the mainstream IT progress from certain distance, making us wonder what was special about spatial. Now, this trend seems to have changed. IT mainstream has realized the power of maps, and any IT technology is looking into maps for flashy visualizations, smart analysis, new functionalities. When everybody needs a map in their life, it is the turn of the geospatial experts... make it happen!
