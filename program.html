                                        The question “What is special about spatial?” has been asked for decades. Do we really need special solutions 
                                        for handling geospatial data? Having this question in mind, the talk will discuss several previous and current 
                                        challenges in spatial data management and their (possible) solutions.

                                        GIS has been for decades a very specialized field strongly dedicated to specific domains such as urban planning or 
                                        environment. GIS experts represent a rich group of diverse professional skills and profiles who have work together 
                                        to merge diverse disciplines such as cartography, topography, design or IT technologies. Far from the big audiences, 
                                        GIS have been watching the mainstream IT progress from certain distance, making us wonder what was special about 
                                        spatial. Now, this trend seems to have changed. IT mainstream has realized the power of maps, and any IT technology 
                                        is looking into maps for flashy visualizations, smart analysis, new functionalities. When everybody needs a map in 
                                        their life, it is the turn of the geospatial experts... make it happen!

                                            <br>
                                            Satellite images are valuable sources to monitor the changes happening in the earth's surface patterns as well as dynamics. However, the analyses of such images often require a long series of remotely-sensed data. In two hands-on sessions, we first cover the use of the R package RGISTools to facilitate the handling of satellite images time series from major satellite programs, such as Landsat, MODIS, and Sentinel, covering in a comprehensive manner the retrieval, and customizing and processing satellite images. Having retrieved and processed satellite images time series of e.g. land surface temperature (LST) and/or vegetation indices from MODIS, we then review some of the most considered change-point and trend detection methods, and make use of them to discuss the areas where have faced changes over time together with the corresponding time of change for some provinces/cities in Europe.
